Notes:

React start at Facebook

Uses virtual DOM and JSX syntax

the Vitual DOM is a JS object
React is fast bc it "reacts" with the virtual DOM and only outputs to the DOM when needed

JSX requires babel
added from cdnjs, use the "babel-core" link

Now make sure that the script tag at with the logic has this header:
<script type="text/babel">
